# CompressionClassification
This repository contains images JPEG-compressed and classified with a pre-trained Inception-v3 model.
The folders contain both the images and the actual scores output by the classifier for each image (together with those for other images which the classifier seems to recognize as similar, at least to some degree) on every level of compression (Q1-Q100).
The excel file contains the statistics for only the images intended for classification, for quick and easy analysis.
